- dont add "Generated by claude code..." in git commits
- add changes and git commit after every logical step/feature
- git push to main branch when the work is done
- start commit message with lowercase letter
- when compiling use verbose mode so i can see the logs
- you don't have sudo access, so dont run commands that require sudo by yourself
